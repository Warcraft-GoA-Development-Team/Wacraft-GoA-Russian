EVTDESC_WCCLS.10002;After a few hours of searching the wilds you notice a large transparent panther near the lake.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_WCCLS.10003;What do you represent, spirit?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WCCLS.10004;I represent the agility which bolsters you as a young druid. You have come to me to learn this power young one, and I will teach this to you.

EVTDESC_WCCLS.10005;Power of the body is the power and swiftness of action. You must keep yourself fit at all times, both physically and mentally.

EVTDESC_WCCLS.10006;Resolve of the heart is what gives you the swiftness to take action... action that is rooted in intentions that are pure and forthright.

EVTDESC_WCCLS.10040;The mysteries of flight are only known to the most talented druids. Your best chance of learning them would be to seek out a druid of the talon. These masters of flight are the most ardent followers of Aviana and know all the secrets of the talon form. They commonly live in high altitude areas where their connection with the Mistress of the Birds is the strongest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WCCLS.10040;Which way leads to the highest mountain?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WCCLS.10041;After a long journey you finally arrived at the foot of a mountain. Climbing such an enormous peak is no easy matter and you decide it is best to make camp and spend the night here.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WCCLS.10041;I need a good sleep to climb that mountain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WCCLS.10042;You woke up to loud caws outside your tent. You leave it quickly to look for a culprit but the crow is nowhere to be found. You're confused by this situation. How can a simple crow elude an experienced druid such as yourself?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WCCLS.10042;Maybe it's a sign?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WCCLS.10043;After weird wakeup you eat a modest breakfast and start climbing the mountain. You estimate that it will take you a few hours to reach its peak. You can only hope that there is actually a druid of the talon living there.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WCCLS.10043;I wish I could fly to the top.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WCCLS.10044;It is nearly dark but you have finally arrived at the mountain's peak. You are tired and dream only of a warm bed back home. And then you suddenly hear a loud caw behind you. It is a crow, but not an ordinary one. It is several times bigger and a lot more deadly. It looks at you and then transforms into a tall night elf. You can see by his appearance that he is the person you've been looking for.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WCCLS.10044;I should talk to him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WCCLS.10045;You approach him and introduce yourself shortly. He looks at you intensely with his sharp eyes before opening his mouth. "I know what you seek, my friend. The mysteries of the flight are only known to a select few and I can see in you potential to join us.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WCCLS.10045;I will prove that I'm worthy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WCCLS.10046;"Prove? No my friend, there's no need for that. There is no exam to pass, no challenge to complete, no problem to overcome. I will pass onto you my knowledge and if you're worthy you will understand it.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WCCLS.10046;Then I'm ready to learn.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WCCLS.10047;Good, my friend. Then I will tell you the secret of flight. It is knowing the true meaning of freedom. As a druid it is your duty to protect Azeroth. You can't just fly away from your obligations and hide in the clouds. The only thing that's limiting your freedom is you. Your doubts, concerns and fears chained you to the earth. True freedom is facing them head on and standing your ground instead of flying away like a coward. This is the mystery of flight. Now take to the skies and feel how free you are!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WCCLS.10047;CAAAAAAW!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WCCLS.10060;You have been studying ways of druidism for many years now. You practiced shapeshifting and attained complete control over it's many forms. But now you choose a new objecitve. To master the way of the stag is to follow Malorne himself, the father of the demigod Cenarius, lover of Elune, the first among the ancient guardians. Following his example is not easy and rarely anyone tries it. You will face many challenges and success is not guaranteed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WCCLS.10060;I will do my best.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WCCLS.10061;To master the way of Malorne you have to gain the blessing of the demigod himself. You will depart on a long journey to understand him and his ways.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WCCLS.10061;I will depart immediately.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_WCCLS.10061;I already bear his blessing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WCCLS.10062;You have gained the blessing of Malorne and will now face a final test. You will undergo a ritual to relive Malorne's memories from War of the Ancients and face Archimonde the Defiler.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WCCLS.10062;I will not fail him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WCCLS.10063;The ritual has begun. As the world swirls around you the vision blurs and you start to hear weird sounds. You see the Defiler before you. Overcome with rage and fury you charge at him with your antlers. The ground trembles under your hooves as you sweep demons aside. You reach your enemy and he barely dodges your attack, saving himself from being impaled. You exhange blows for hours and you're getting more and more tired with each passing moment. Archimonde notices it and grabs your neck with his demonic strength. You struggle to free yourself but to no avail. He snaps your neck and as you leave the vision, the last thing you hear is furious roar of Ysera.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WCCLS.10063;I still weep for the White Stag.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WCCLS.10064;You have overcome Malornes challenge and gained insight about his being. With all these things you have strengthened your connection with the Waywatcher and mastered the stag form. You will use this power as Malorne himself would, to defend Azeroth and its inhabitants.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WCCLS.10064;I will always follow your example.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
